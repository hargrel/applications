			<h2>Agency Sample Application</h2>
			<p>This is a sample application to demonstrate how the interaction with the Queensland Government Client Identity Management System (QGCIDM) would work.</p>
			<p>As a Queensland Government Agency, your website will make use of the QGCIDM in a similar way to this. That is, your website may have a number of different services on it with different security needs.</p>
			<p><i>It will be up to you to determine which services require what level of protection.</i></p>
			<p>Note the difference between a Credential Provider (CP) and an Identity (ID). CPs such as Google or AUSKey are used to log on to the system while the ID is the actual user data that is being protected.</p>
			<p>As a matter of privacy, the QGCIDM stores very minimal information about an individual. These details are; first name, last name and date of birth. Other information, such as the user's email address may be requested by your application however delivery is on a <a href="#">best effort</a> basis.</p>
			<p>When a user verifies their identity documents online, the document details are discarded and the user is left with a tick or cross against the particular document that has been shown. Because sensitive user data is not kept, it cannot be lost or stolen.</p>
<!-- 			<p>It contains a number of separate services which require different levels of security. Each service will ask the QGCIDM to make sure that the user has fulfilled the requirements of the requested security level. Once that assurance has been provided, the user is then allowed to view the secured section of the application.</p>
			<p>This application also highlights the difference between a Credential Provider such as Google or AUSKey (abbreviated to CP and represented by the key icon) and an online Identity (abbreviated to ID and represented by the person icon). Online Identities contain a minimal set of verified information about a person, which can be combined with a Credential Provider to give confidence that the user is who they say they are.</p> 
			<p>In terms of security strength, green represents a standard security level while blue represents a strong security level.</p>

			<li id="service1">
				<h2>
					<a href="#">Basic Use Case</a>
				</h2>
				<p>A basic CP with a basic ID.</p>
				<p class="description">This combination provides basic assurance that a person is who they say they are, and is sufficient for most services that require a user to log in and provide minimal information about themselves.</p>
			</li>
			<li id="service2">
				<h2>
					<a href="#">Standard Use Case</a>
				</h2>
				<p>A secure CP with a verified ID.</p>
				<p class="description">Used when the Agency service requires strong assurance that a person is who they say they are. Forces a user to log in securely and to have verified a minimal set of <a href="#">identity documents</a> such as a Birth Certificate, Passport or Driver Licence.</p>
			</li>
			<li id="service3">
				<h2>
					<a href="#">High Security Use Case</a>
				</h2>
				<p>An extra secure CP with a true online ID.</p>
				<p class="description"><b>Not yet implemented</b>. At present the technology required for this level of assurance is not available. Requires biometrics and/or proof of <i>presence within the community</i> as well as extra security measures during the log in process.</p>
			</li>
<!-- 			<li id="service3">
				<h2>
					<a href="#">Authentication Use Case</a>
				</h2>
				<p>Uses a strong CP with a standard ID.</p>
				<p class="description">Allows the Agency service to force the user to log into their Identity with a strong Credential Provider. This rare combination essentially just uses the QGCIDM as a strong authentication mechanism, providing minimal information about the user themselves.</p>
			</li>
			<li id="service4">
				<h2>
					<a href="#">Prohibited Use Case</a>
				</h2>
				<p>Uses a standard CP with a strong ID.</p>
				<p class="description">Not allowed for security reasons. The service is requesting a strong Identity protected by a standard Credential Provider, a combination which is forbidden as the user's Identity is not sufficiently protected.</p>
